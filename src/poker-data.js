export var GLOSSARY = {
  "Careful": "💡 The 'Rock.' This player only plays premium hands. If they are betting, they aren't kidding—they have something strong.",
  "Regular": "💡 A disciplined strategist. They play a balanced game, mixing strong hands with calculated bluffs to keep you guessing.",
  "Aggro": "💡 A high-pressure player who uses chips as a weapon. They win by making you uncomfortable enough to fold.",
  "UTG": "💡 Under the Gun. First to act with the whole table waiting to pounce. You need a powerhouse hand to survive crossfire.",
  "MP": "💡 Middle Position. Not good, not terrible. You need strong hands to have a chance since the best seats act after you.",
  "CO": "💡 Cut-Off. A prime seat to 'steal' the pot before the dealer gets a chance. Only two players left to act after you.",
  "BTN": "💡 The Button. The best seat in the house. You act last, getting a free look at everyone's moves before you make yours.",
  "SB": "💡 Small Blind. A forced bet in a tough spot. You act first after the flop, making it an uphill battle to win the hand.",
  "BB": "💡 Big Blind. Forced bet. You get a 'discount' to see the flop, but you'll be defending your territory from a difficult position later.",
  "BB_unit": "💡 The currency of poker strategy. It measures your stack size relative to the stakes rather than the dollar amount.",
  "preflop": "💡 The opening act. You only know your two private cards and the strength of your position.",
  "flop": "💡 The first three shared cards. This is where most hands are won, lost, or defined.",
  "turn": "💡 The fourth shared card. The plot thickens and the price of staying in the hand usually goes up.",
  "river": "💡 The fifth and final card. No more help is coming—it's time for the moment of truth.",
  "overpair": "💡 Your pocket pair is higher than any card on the board. A strong hand, but watch out for 'wet' boards.",
  "top pair": "💡 You paired the highest card on the table. A reliable hand, though its strength depends on your second card (the kicker).",
  "middle pair": "💡 One of your cards matches a middle card on the board. Vulnerable to anyone with the top pair; proceed with caution.",
  "bottom pair": "💡 You paired the lowest card on the table. Often a 'fold' waiting to happen unless you're catching a bluff.",
  "two pair": "💡 Strong if both pairs come from your hole cards, but riskier if one pair is shared by everyone on the board.",
  "three of a kind": "💡 A powerhouse hand that often stays hidden, ready to trap over-confident opponents.",
  "full house": "💡 Three of a kind plus a pair. A near-invincible hand that usually takes down the entire pot.",
  "flush": "💡 Five cards of the same suit. Strong and hard to beat, unless the board shows a pair for a possible full house.",
  "straight": "💡 Five cards in numerical order. A deceptive hand that can crush players holding high pairs.",
  "underpair": "💡 Your pocket pair is lower than everything on the board. You're looking for a miracle or a quick exit.",
  "ace high": "💡 No pair, just an Ace. Sometimes enough to win against a total bluff, but rarely enough to bet on.",
  "overcards": "💡 No pair yet, but both your cards are higher than the board. You're looking for a lucky catch on the next street.",
  "pocket pair": "💡 Two of the same card in your hand. A head start that can turn into a monster if you hit a third matching card.",
  "high card": "💡 The weakest possible hand. If you're here at the river, you're either bluffing or losing.",
  "flush draw": "💡 You have four cards of one suit and need one more. You have a ~35% chance to hit by the river.",
  "straight draw": "💡 You're one card short of a straight. A work-in-progress hand that needs the right card to become profitable.",
  "open-ended": "💡 Four cards in a row that can be completed at either end. With 8 possible 'outs,' you have a solid chance at glory.",
  "OESD": "💡 Open-Ended Straight Draw. You have 8 cards in the deck that can complete your hand. One of the best draws to have.",
  "gutshot": "💡 An 'inside' straight draw. You need one specific middle card to hit. A long shot, but it hits like a bolt of lightning.",
  "semi-bluff": "💡 Betting with a weak hand that has potential. You win by forcing a fold now or hitting your card later.",
  "bluff-catcher": "💡 A hand that can't beat a serious bet but crushes a lie. You're playing a game of 'I don't believe you.'",
  "pot odds": "💡 The price of the 'call' versus the size of the prize. Tells you if your draw is a smart investment or a bad gamble.",
  "+EV": "💡 Positive Expected Value. A move that makes money over the long run, even if this specific hand ends in disaster.",
  "value": "💡 Betting because you want to get paid. You believe you have the best hand and want the opponent to call with worse.",
  "profitable": "💡 A play that consistently adds to your stack over hundreds of sessions.",
  "Wet board": "💡 Coordinated cards where straights and flushes are lurking. Your strong hand might need an umbrella.",
  "Dry board": "💡 Disconnected and safe. If you have the best hand now, you'll likely have it on the river.",
  "Mixed board": "💡 Between wet and dry—some draws are possible, but the board isn't a total minefield yet.",
  "Fold": "💡 Releasing your cards. The most important move in poker—it saves you from losing chips you don't have to.",
  "Call": "💡 Matching the current bet. You're paying to see the next card or to reach the showdown.",
  "Raise": "💡 Increasing the price of admission. It forces your opponents to have a real hand or get out of the way.",
  "3-Bet": "💡 The first re-raise. It turns up the heat to build a pot with strong hands, seize control of the action, or pressure a weak raiser into folding.",
  "Check": "💡 A tactical pass. Use it to see a free card or to set a trap for an aggressive opponent.",
  "Bet": "💡 Being the first to put chips in. It takes the lead and puts the pressure on everyone else.",
  "range": "💡 The set of hands an opponent could be playing based on their actions and player type.",
  "fold equity": "💡 How often your opponent folds when you bet. Use it: if they fold enough, even a bluff with no hand is profitable. Key math — your bet needs to work often enough to cover the risk.",
  "initiative": "💡 The betting lead — you have it if you were the last to raise or bet. Use it: opponents expect aggression from you, so continuation bets and barrels get more folds. Without it, you need a stronger reason to bet — like high fold equity or a real hand.",
  "c-bet": "💡 Continuation bet — betting the flop after you raised preflop. Use it: on dry boards against one opponent, a small c-bet takes it down often. Skip it on wet boards when you have nothing.",
  "continuation bet": "💡 Continuation bet — betting the flop after you raised preflop. Use it: on dry boards against one opponent, a small c-bet takes it down often. Skip it on wet boards when you have nothing.",
  "betting lead": "💡 The betting lead — you have it if you were the last to raise or bet. Opponents expect aggression from you, so continuation bets and barrels get more folds. Without it, you need a stronger reason to bet — like high fold equity or a real hand.",
  "double barrel": "💡 Betting the turn after c-betting the flop. Use it: when a scare card hits that helps your story, or when the opponent's calling range is weak. Give up if the board got worse for you.",
  "probe bet": "💡 Betting into someone who had the lead but checked. Use it: their check shows weakness — a small bet can take the pot. Only probe with some equity or on boards that favor your range.",
  "bet sizing": "💡 How much you bet relative to the pot. Use small bets (around a third) on dry boards or for thin value. Use big bets (around three quarters) on wet boards to charge draws and protect your hand.",
